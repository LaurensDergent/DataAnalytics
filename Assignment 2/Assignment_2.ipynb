    "In this assignment the goal is to be able to price a game based on an image. This will be done using a convolutional neural network.\n",

    "1. Building a CNN that does not take into consideration that some screenshots belong to the same game.\n",
    "1. Building a CNN that takes into consideration that some screenshots belong to the same game by stitching the screenshots of a game together to create one large image. This large image is then fed into the CNN. \n",
    "1. Building a CNN that takes into consideration that some screenshots belong to the same game by using multiple screenshots of a game as input of a multi-branch CNN with a concatenated layer.\n",

    "First, some general pre-processing is discussed. This ensures that the same splits will be used for each method. Then, for each method the pre-processing steps are discussed. Then each model with the necessary evaluation criteria is built. Then, based on the the evaluation metric, the best of the three beforementioned methods is selected. Lastly, some interpretability techniques to get insights on the model is given. "
